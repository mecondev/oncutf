# Delegate Refactoring Plan - Phase 3 Complete

## Overview
MainWindow contained 58 delegate methods that forwarded calls to managers. These have been successfully migrated to the Application Service Layer for better architecture.

## Progress Status
- **Phase 1**: 20/58 methods (34.5%) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2**: 38/58 methods (65.5%) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 3**: Cleanup & Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- **Total**: 58/58 methods (100%) ✅ COMPLETE

## Phase 3 Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Fixed missing method**: Added `reload_current_folder()` to Application Service
- [x] **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up imports in main_window.py
- [x] **Fixed type annotations**: Corrected method signatures
- [x] **Added missing imports**: Fixed FileItem import in Application Service
- [x] **Improved documentation**: Enhanced docstrings for clarity

### 2. Testing & Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **MainWindow initialization**: ✅ Success
