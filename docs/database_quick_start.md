# Database System Quick Start

## Overview

The oncutf application now includes a comprehensive database system that provides:

- **Persistent Metadata Storage**: Metadata storage that persists between sessions
- **Hash Caching**: Persistent caching of CRC32 hashes for improved performance
- **Rename History**: Undo/redo functionality for rename operations
- **Enhanced Performance**: Memory caching with database fallback

## Core Features

### üóÑÔ∏è Persistent Storage
- All metadata and hashes are stored permanently
- Fast access with memory caching
- Automatic maintenance and cleanup

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo Functionality
- Complete tracking of rename operations
- Undo with validation and integrity checking
- Batch operations support

### ‚ö° Performance
- Thread-safe operations
- Connection pooling
- Optimized database queries
- Lazy loading with smart caching

## Usage

### Automatic Activation
The database system is automatically activated when the application starts. No configuration required.

### Database Location
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/oncutf/oncutf_data.db`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/oncutf/oncutf_data.db`

### New Features

#### Rename History
- Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo the last rename operation
- View complete history through the Tools menu
- Validation for safe undo operations

#### Database Statistics
- View database usage statistics
- Monitor cache performance
- Cleanup tools for old data

## Testing

To test the new system:

```bash
python scripts/test_database_system.py
```

This script:
- Creates test data
- Tests all functionality
- Verifies correct operation
- Cleans up temporary files

## Backward Compatibility

The new system is fully backward compatible:
- Existing code continues to work
- Old APIs are preserved
- Automatic migration from memory-only caches
- Graceful fallback in case of problems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Locked**: Usually resolves automatically
2. **Permission Errors**: Check permissions on the data directory
3. **Performance Issues**: Use cleanup tools

### Debug Mode
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('core.database_manager').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Manual Reset
If there are problems:
1. Close the application
2. Delete the database file
3. Restart (a new database will be created)
