Module: rename_conflict_resolver.py

This module provides a conflict resolution system for file rename operations.
It handles cases where target files already exist and provides strategies
for resolving conflicts without blocking the main application thread.

Classes:
    RenameConflictResolver: Main class for handling rename conflicts
    ConflictResolutionStrategy: Enum for different resolution strategies
